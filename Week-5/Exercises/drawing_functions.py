"""Minimal drawing helper used by the exercises.

This provides two functions expected by the exercises:
- load(circles): store a reference to the currently active circles (no heavy logic)
- present_for(exp, circles, num_frames): attempt to plot stimuli if possible,
  otherwise fall back to waiting for the requested number of frames.

The implementation is intentionally tolerant so it won't crash the exercise when
run in environments where expyriment's full display stack isn't available.
